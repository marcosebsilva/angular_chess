Little chess game.
I am awfully bad at chess but i do still like it. Recently i got fascinated by the Chess programming world and decided that i want to try my own.
To make it feel like this is somewhat useful, i decided to give my first shot while learning Angular. For that reason, this code is nasty in terms of optimization
but it helped me to wrap my head around some problems that i may face.

Im on the process of moving all the logic to a proper backend, so all the handling done in this client application will probably be gone.
